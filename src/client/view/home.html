		<p>Thank you for your interest in tellem. This is a demonstration of the core functionality of tellem - real-time, channel-based notifications.</p>
		<h4>Using the Demo</h4>
		<p>The demo is currently running on development infrastructure, so <strong>avoid sending any personal data</strong> via tellem for the moment. Besides that, feel free to play around. Please note that the channels you currently see are shared amongst all demo users, so don't be alarmed if things change.</p>
		<p>For the moment, you can create channels, subscribe/unsubscribe to those channels, and send bulletins. Hopefully it shows how tellem would be used within an organization or team.</p>
		<h4>Getting Started</h4>
		<p>Click some of the channels on the left for information on them. You can also create your own channels with the plus button.</p>
		<h4>Feedback</h4>
		<p>Your feedback is incredibly appreciated &amp; helpful. You can click <a href='http://goo.gl/forms/UQ5AI7T6Sd' target='_blank'>Leave Feedback</a> and complete a short survey (only 3 questions).</p>
		<h4>Contact</h4>
		<p>If you need to get in touch you can either reach me via <a href='mailto:{{contactMail}}'>e-mail</a> or <a href='https://twitter.com/use_tellem' target='_blank'>Twitter</a>.</p>
